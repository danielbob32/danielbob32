Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Daniel Bobritski, a computer science student at the University of Haifa. This profile showcases my projects and contributions in fields like computer vision, deep learning, and application development. Feel free to explore and engage with my work.


## Projects

### üöó Parking Management System
A comprehensive solution for managing parking spaces using computer vision. This project leverages OpenCV and YOLO for real-time video processing.

### üì∏ Facial Verification App (Under Construction)
A Python-based application utilizing Siamese neural networks for facial verification. This project includes the implementation and training of the network from scratch and is currently under development.

### üé¨ Movie Theater Management System (Team Project, Under Construction)
A JavaFX application for managing movie theaters. Features include client-server communication using OCSF, MySQL ORM, and Event Bus for event-driven programming. This is a collaborative project with my team and is currently in progress.

### üîç Hough Transform
An in-depth exploration and application of the Hough Transform for detecting geometric shapes in images, particularly triangles. This project demonstrates the implementation of edge detection and line detection techniques.

### üåê Parking Space Web (PSWeb)
A formal web application built using HTML and CSS to manage parking spaces. This project complements the Parking Management System by providing a user-friendly web interface for interaction and is deployed using GitHub Pages.
